* The Problem
It's hard to exchange data between systems in the healthcare industry.

* What is FHIR?
Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources

FHIR is a framework for working with data in healthcare applications.

Its goal is to enable /interoperability/ of our healthcare data.

** Technical
FHIR defines:
- A collection of data models that might come in handy when building a healthcare application.
- A RESTful API for interacting with healthcare data which conforms to these data models.
- Ways of extending itself to model healthcare data in a wide range of use-cases and jurisdictions.

*** Datatypes, primitive and complex
FHIR defines its own type system.

The following are several types that FHIR provides:

**** Example: ~DateTime~
A *primitive* type: Encodes one value

~DateTime~ Helps to standardise on one unambiguous date format

#+begin_src ruby :results output
require 'date'
%w[%Y %Y-%m %Y-%m-%d %Y-%m-%dT%T %Y-%m-%dT%T%z].each { |f| puts DateTime.now.strftime f }
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: 2023
: 2023-07
: 2023-07-26
: 2023-07-26T19:40:50
: 2023-07-26T19:40:50+1000

All of the above are valid values for a FHIR ~DateTime~
**** Example: ~HumanName~
A *complex* type: Composed of primitive types and other complex types

~HumanName~: Has thought of things that you wouldn't have

[[file:resources/human_name.svg]]

*** Resources
Resources are another kind of data model in FHIR, comprising values with primitive and complex types.

They model domain-specific entities.

They are the 'R' in FHIR.

**** Example: Patient
"Demographics and other administrative information about an individual or animal receiving care or other health-related services."
[[file:resources/patient_resource.svg]]

***** Example
A FHIR Patient serialised to JSON

XML and Turtle representations are also supported.

#+begin_src json
{
  "resourceType" : "Patient",
  "id" : "xcda",
  "identifier" : [{
    "use" : "usual",
    "type" : {
      "coding" : [{
        "system" : "http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v2-0203",
        "code" : "MR"
      }]
    },
    "system" : "urn:oid:2.16.840.1.113883.19.5",
    "value" : "12345"
  }],
  "active" : true,

  "managingOrganization" : {
    "reference" : "Organization/2.16.840.1.113883.19.5",

  }
}
#+end_src
**** Example: VisionPrescription
"An authorization for the provision of glasses and/or contact lenses to a patient."
[[file:resources/vision_prescription.svg]]

**** Example: StructureDefinition
The FHIR standard is machine-readable, and defined in... FHIR.

Each resource, extension, complex datatype and primitive datatype has a corresponding StructureDefinition.
[[file:resources/structure_definition.svg]]

*** Extensions
FHIR isn't unilateral. It's the beginning of a collaboration.

Extensions allow us to add new attributes to a resource, without changing the data model.
**** Example of an extension

*** Profiles
FHIR is flexible, which helps it to model a wide variety of data. But if every resource can be extended arbitrarily, how is it interoperable?

A *profile* is a specification for a resource. It specifies:
- Extensions that should be present
- When certain attributes and extensions should be used
- Additional validations

FHIR is only interoperable /within the context of a profile/.
#+attr_html: :width 100%
[[file:resources/blur_to_focus.jpg]]
**** Example: AU Base
[[https://build.fhir.org/ig/hl7au/au-fhir-base/][AU Base]] is a set of profiles published by HL7 Australia, in collaboration with the ADHA, CSIRO and the broader Australian FHIR implementers community.

It prescribes representations of concepts that are unique to the Australian healthcare context, including:
- Closing the Gap registration and Indigenous Status
- Medicare Card, including expiry month/year
- Australian Business Number (ABN)
- Australia Post Delivery Point Identifier (DPID)

** Social: The FHIR Community
A strong community is essential to the success of any project. FHIR has a strong community.

*** Connectathons
In-person and online events, where community members gather to create new profiles, resources and tooling.

Each event is focused on a few narrow topics, e.g., radiology requests, authentication.

Connectathons help to ensure that FHIR is relevant and useful.
*** FHIR chat
Zulip forum at [[https://chat.fhir.org/]]
- Active
- Significant decisions are made here
- Community leaders are present, and willing to answer questions from beginners

** Political: FHIR in Public Policy
Advocacy from the FHIR project has led to its use being mandated at the government level.

*** 21st Century Cures Act (2016)
Aimed to enable Patients to have free and immediate access to their medical record.

Mandated the future use of FHIR for healthcare data exchange in the USA.
*** NHS Spine
/Spine/ is "a central, secure system for patient data in England"

 NHS Digital are progressively deprecating legacy APIs where a FHIR equivalent exists.
*** ADHA: National Healthcare Interoperability Plan 2023-2028
Seeks to improve interoperability of healthcare data in Australia.

Work continues on a FHIR gateway for My Health Record.
* The Virtuous Cycle
#+attr_html: :width 80%

* Summary
- FHIR gives developers a strong technical foundation for building applications that operate on healthcare data. Take it and build something!
- FHIR is extensible, ensuring its relevance in many use-cases
- FHIR profiles give us a vocabulary with which to standardise and communicate shared data models
- FHIR has a strong community to support its adoption
- FHIR adoption is increasingly viable, thanks to government mandates that expose healthcare data via FHIR APIs

* Thanks for listening!
Any questions?
